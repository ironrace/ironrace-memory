## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- MCP server (`ironmem serve`) with JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio
- Semantic search via HNSW index (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 ONNX embeddings, 384-dim)
- Knowledge graph with temporal triples — add, query, invalidate, timeline
- Memory graph traversal — BFS, tunnel detection, graph stats
- Diary read/write with wing-scoped entries
- Drawer CRUD — add, delete, list wings/rooms, full taxonomy
- Incremental workspace mining (`ironmem mine`) with SHA-256 manifest cache
- ChromaDB/mempalace migration (`ironmem migrate --from <path>`)
- Auto-bootstrap on first `serve` or `hook` — migrate-or-init + initial mine; disable with `IRONMEM_AUTO_BOOTSTRAP=0`
- `IRONMEM_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to pin the auto-mine target without passing it on the command line
- `IRONMEM_MIGRATE_FROM` to point migration at a custom ChromaDB store path
- `IRONMEM_DB_PATH`, `IRONMEM_MODEL_DIR`, `IRONMEM_MCP_MODE` for runtime config overrides
- Hook support for Claude Code and Codex: `session-start`, `stop`, `precompact`
- Three MCP access modes: `trusted`, `read-only`, `restricted`
- Input sanitization and content length limits on all write paths
- WAL audit log with automatic 30-day pruning
- SHA-256 checksum verification on model download
- Plugin packaging for Claude Code (`.claude-plugin/`)
- Plugin packaging for Codex (`.codex-plugin/`)
- Memory protocol guidance returned from `ironmem_status` and surfaced in plugin `defaultPrompt`
- Non-blocking startup: DB opens in Phase 1 (<50 ms); ONNX model loads in a background thread with `warming_up` status flag
- Embedder hot-swap on first tool call after background init completes
- `IRONMEM_EMBED_MODE=noop` for smoke tests and CI without the ONNX model
- `IRONMEM_DISABLE_MIGRATION=1` to skip first-run mempalace migration
- Stale `bootstrap.lock` auto-recovery on startup
- MCP smoke test script (`scripts/mcp_smoke_test.py`)
- Tag-triggered release workflow with macOS and Linux binary archives
- Integration tests: MCP protocol contract, plugin metadata validation, mining end-to-end, bootstrap races, migration corruption/idempotency

### Changed

- Search overfetch increased from 3x to 5x (minimum 30 candidates)
- Mining skips hidden files and directories by default; set `IRONMEM_MINE_HIDDEN=1` to index dot-paths
- Bootstrap no longer infers workspace from `cwd`; explicit roots required for auto-mining
- `serve` fails closed on bootstrap errors instead of starting with partial initialization
- Re-mining replaces a file's drawers transactionally after embeddings are computed
- Migration from ChromaDB imports drawers and knowledge-graph data transactionally
- Hook session summaries land in the same diary stream as normal diary writes

### Fixed

- Sanitized `cwd` and `transcript_path` values before hook diary persistence
- Rejected system directory prefixes for mining and migration inputs
- Removed `.env` from the mining allowlist
- Added bounded SQLite busy retries during startup schema work
- Serialized env-var-mutating bootstrap tests to prevent race conditions

### Removed

- `properties` field from the `entities` table and `Entity` struct
